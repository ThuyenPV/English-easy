### How do I use this project?
This is a boilerplate project aimed to help bootstrap new Android MVP Applications. Feel free to fork this application or use [AndroidStarters](http://androidstarters.com/) to create new app using this boilerplate.

# MVP template

When we follow any architecture pattern like MVP, MVVM, MVP clean, we always come across a small but repetitive task to create basic files like Android Activity, Presenter, View, Api models and then writing boiler plate code. This usually takes 1-2 hours for each single screen. To ease out work and save time We have created an automated template which will do above work in less than 20 seconds.
